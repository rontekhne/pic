/* exe0308. To round off an integer i to the next largest even multiple of 
 * another integer j, the following formula can be used:
 * Next_multiple = i + j - i % j
 * For example, to round off 256 days to the next largest number of days
 * evenly divisible by a week, values of i = 256 and j = 7 can be 
 * substituted into the preceding formula as follows:
 * Next_multiple = 256 + 7 - 256 % 7
 *               = 256 + 7 - 4
 *               = 259
